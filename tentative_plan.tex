We will first carry out a study of Spark's \cite{Spark} performance on a single workload from a publically accepted benchmark and run it on Firebox.
%in detail the differences in resource consumption between running on the commodity hardware architecture and Firebox.
This step will help us setup the software environment in addition to gaining insight on performance characteristics of Spark on Firebox. Next, we will run the remaining workloads from the benchmark in order and strengthen our understandings. Table 1 presents some benchmarks we can use to conduct this study. We plan to use the Big Data Benchmark because 1) it targets large-scale data processing systems we envision running on Firebox, 2) it has been used in the past to benchmark other analystics systems, and 3) it contains types of workloads (e.g., the join query workload) that we believe can be improved with the Firebox architecture, given its larger memory pool and faster network interconnects.
